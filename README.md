# Enthymeme-Solver
Produces a proof for all possible enthymemes!


An enthymeme is an incomplete categorical argument.
An example:
"He is a U.S. citizen, so he is entitled to due process." 
There is a premise missing, namely that all U.S citizens are entitled to due process.

My program iterates through all possible enthymatic forms, and identifies which ones are impossible to make valid. It places those forms into a file called Output.txt. However, proofs for all possible enthymemes are logged in log.txt.
